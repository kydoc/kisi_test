<h3>In this article we'll detail how to connect the Kisi Controller Pro to a single fail-safe lock.</h3>

While connecting the Kisi Controller Pro to the lock will allow you to unlock the door with the Kisi App, It's a good idea to add a "request to exit" (REX) on the inside of the secured space, and a keypad or card reader on the outside. These devices will enable you to unlock even if the Kisi Controller is not accessible from the internet. Click [here](https://help.kisi.io/hc/en-us/articles/360007494813-Recommended-Electric-Locks-Other-Equipment) for help with choosing and installing these devices.

This access control installation consists of the following:
* Kisi Controller Pro (comes with a 24V Universal AC power supply)
* 12 or 24V DC fail safe electric strike or magnetic lock (purchased separately)
* low voltage wires (purchased separately)

<h3>Connecting the controller to the first lock</h3>

Before you begin, please refer to the [Kisi controller pro documentation](https://help.kisi.io/hc/en-us/sections/115002573127-Kisi-Controller-Pro-1-1-)  for assistance in correctly identifying the controller components, and for help in setting up the controller. In addition, consult the product documentation for your electric lock to ensure that you choose the correct voltage, and for help in correctly identifying the wires.

* Start by connecting the positive wire to the correct voltage position on the first relay. The negative wire should then be connected to NC (Normally Closed). Following this, connect a jumper wire from Common (COM) to Ground (GND). 
* Connect the black wire from the supplied power source to Ground (GND), and the white wire to the 24V position. When the device has power a blue LED should light up.
* Plug your ethernet cable into the RJ45 port on the controller. 

You now have the installation wired up, powered up, and connected to your network. [Learn more about how to configure this installation in the Kisi web dashboard](https://help.kisi.io/hc/en-us/sections/115002573047-Kisi-Web-Dashboard).
