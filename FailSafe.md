<h3>Ready to connect your first lock?</h3> 
<p>
Go on, you can do it! Two strands of low voltage wire, an electric lock and a little bitty screwdriver are all that you need!

Please refer to the product documentation for your electric lock to ensure you’re choosing the correct voltage, and for help in identifying the positive and negative  wires. When you’ve identified the positive wire to the correct voltage postition on the first relay. The negative wire should then be connected to NC (Normally Closed). Almost there! The last step is to connect a jumper wire from Common to Ground. Now your lock is connected! That wasn’t so hard, was it?

<h3>But wait, there’s more fun to be had!</h3>  

Why not connect a Request to Exit (REX) device? It’s a good idea to have a method for people to open the door from the inside without using Kisi. Typically a  REX would be a push to open button, a keypad, or a motion sensor. Speaking of a keypad, you should probably install a keypad on the outside just in case the network controller connection fails. 

To connect the REX run a pair of low voltage wires between the REX and the IN1 (Input 1) and GND (ground). Refer to the documentation supplied with your REX device to identify the correct wires to connect. 

<h3>You have a lock and a REX. Now you need to connect the power, and network connections.</h3>

Power is easy. Connect the black wire from the power source to Ground (GND), and the white wire to the 24V position. If you’ve done it right, a blue LED should light up.

The network is even easier: Plug in your ethernet cable. 

Now you're ready to test!
