<h3>Connecting your first lock</h3> 
<p>
Two strands of low voltage wire, an electric lock and a little bitty screwdriver are all that you need!
</p>
<p>
**Note:** Refer to the product documentation for your electric lock to ensure you’re choosing the correct voltage, and for help in identifying the positive and negative wires. 
  
To start, connect the positive wire to the correct voltage postition on the first relay. The negative wire should then be connected to NC (Normally Closed). Following this, connect a jumper wire from Common to Ground.

<h3>Connecting REX devices</h3>  

It’s a good idea to have a method for people to open the door from the inside without using Kisi. Typically a REX would be a push to open button, a keypad, or a motion sensor. It's good practice to install a keypad on the outside of the space just in case the network connection fails, and the Kisi controller cannot be reached. 

To connect the REX run a pair of low voltage wires between the REX and the IN1 (Input 1) and GND (ground). Again, refer to the documentation supplied with your REX device to identify the correct wires to connect. 

<h3>Powering and Network connections</h3>

Connect the black wire from the supplied power source to Ground (GND), and the white wire to the 24V position. When the device has power a blue LED should light up.

Plug in your ethernet cable into the RJ45 socket on the controller.
