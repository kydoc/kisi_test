An access control installation consists of several parts. 

* Kisi Controller Pro
* Electric Strike or Magnetic lock
* REX (optional)
* Keypad (optional)
* Reader (optional)

In this article we'll detail how to connect the Kisi Controller Pro to a fail-safe lock.

The Kisi Controller Pro comes with a 24V Universal AC power supply. To complete the installation you will need to source the following:

* 12 or 24V DC fail safe electric strike or magnetic lock
* Ethernet Cable
* Low Voltage Wires

<h3>Things you didn’t get that you’ll need to purchase elsewhere:</h3>

<h3>Connecting the controller to the first lock</h3> 
<p>
Two strands of low voltage wire, an electric lock and a little bitty screwdriver are all that you need!

** Note: ** Refer to the product documentation for your electric lock to ensure you’re choosing the correct voltage, and for help in identifying the positive and negative wires. 
  
To start, connect the positive wire to the correct voltage postition on the first relay. The negative wire should then be connected to NC (Normally Closed). Following this, connect a jumper wire from Common to Ground. 
</p>
<h3>Power and Network connections</h3>

Connect the black wire from the supplied power source to Ground (GND), and the white wire to the 24V position. When the device has power a blue LED should light up.

Plug in your ethernet cable into the RJ45 socket on the controller.
