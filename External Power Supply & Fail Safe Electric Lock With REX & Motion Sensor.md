<h3>Connecting the Kisi Controller Pro to a fail-safe lock with external power, in combination with a push to exit button and a motion sensor.</h3>


  
Connecting the Kisi Controller Pro to the lock will allow you to unlock the door with the Kisi App. With a "push to exit" button on the inside of the secured space the door can be opened even without the app. You should also consider placing a keypad or card reader on the outside of the secured space, just in case the Kisi Controller is not accessible from the internet.
