<h3>In this article we'll detail how to connect the Kisi Controller Pro to a fail-safe lock with external power, and also add a push to exit button as well as a motion sensor.</h3>

An access control installation consists of several parts. 
* Kisi Controller Pro
* 12 or 24V DC fail safe electric strike or magnetic lock
* Push to open button
* Motion sensor
* Keypad (optional)
* Reader (optional)

Connecting the Kisi Controller Pro to the lock will allow you to unlock the door with the Kisi App. With a "request to exit" (REX) on the inside of the secured space the door can be opened even without the app. You should also consider placing a keypad or card reader on the outside of the secured space just in case the Kisi Controller is not accessible from the internet. See the following articles for help with installing the keypad/cardreader
