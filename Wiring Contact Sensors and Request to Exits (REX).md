<h3>In this article we'll detail how to connect the Kisi Controller Pro to a REX and motion sensor.</h3>

An access control installation consists of several parts. 
* Kisi Controller Pro
* 12 or 24V DC fail safe electric strike or magnetic lock
* REX (optional)
* Keypad (optional)
* Reader (optional)

If you wish to incorporate contact sensors or request to exits (REX), i.e. - a push to exit button or a motion sensor, into your Kisi system, you can wire them directly to your Kisi controller by following the steps below:
Connecting the Kisi Controller Pro to the lock will allow you to unlock the door with the Kisi App. It's a good idea to add a "request to exit" (REX) on the inside of the secured space to allow egress without the app, and a keypad or other access device on the outside of the secured space just in case the Kisi Controller is not accessible from the internet. See the following artiles for help with this:
