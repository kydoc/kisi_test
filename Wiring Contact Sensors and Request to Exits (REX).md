<h3>In this article we'll detail how to connect the Kisi Controller Pro to a REX and motion sensor.</h3>

Connecting the Kisi Controller Pro to the lock is the basic installation which allows you to unlock the door with the Kisi App. The addition of a push button "request to exit" (REX) and a motion sensor on the inside of the secured space allows one to unlock the door without the app. Adding a [keypad](https://www.getkisi.com/lessons/how-to-install-an-door-access-control-system) or other access device on the outside of the secured space is a good idea just in case the Kisi Controller is not accessible from the internet. 

Installing [contact sensors](https://www.getkisi.com/lessons/how-to-install-an-door-access-control-system) into your Kisi system allows Kisi to recognize whether the door has actually been opened after being unlocked and to log an event in the Kisi admin dashboard. 

This access control installation consists of the following: 
* Kisi Controller Pro (comes with a 24V Universal AC power supply)
* A contact sensor (purchased seperately)
* A push to open button (purchased seperately)
